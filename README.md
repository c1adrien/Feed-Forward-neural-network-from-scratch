# Feed-Forward-neural-network-from-scratch
This Python code provides an implementation of a feed-forward neural network using only basic mathematical operations, without relying on any external libraries or frameworks. 
The code includes functions for initializing the weights and biases, computing the forward pass through the network, and updating the weights and biases during backpropagation. 
The user can specify the number of hidden layers, the number of nodes in each layer, the activation function, and the loss function to be used.
